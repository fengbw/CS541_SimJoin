    ## Test Case1: Check number of matched pairs (In bash)
    ## Manually run `wc -l answer.csv` & `wc -l out.csv` to check if number matches.

    ## Test Case2: Validate the output using `diff` (In bash)
    ## diff -y --suppress-common-lines answer.csv out.csv | grep '^' | wc -l

    ## Note for `diff`: Since different OS use different symbol for newline, for your own testing phase,
    ##                  you might want to use `dos2unix` to transfer windows newlines into unix type before using `diff`
